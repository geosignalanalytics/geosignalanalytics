<section id="services">
  <h2>Services</h2>
  <p>At GeoSignal Analytics, we offer cutting-edge scientific and technical services tailored to the needs of research institutions, energy companies, and environmental agencies. Our core services for 2025–2026 include:</p>

  <h3>1. Seismic Data Denoising & Enhancement</h3>
  <p>We apply advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in large seismic datasets, including Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) and conventional geophone arrays. Our denoising pipelines preserve critical subsurface features while reducing artifacts and noise.</p>

  <h3>2. Ambient Noise Interferometry & Subsurface Imaging</h3>
  <p>We process ambient seismic data to extract empirical Green’s functions and provide high-resolution images of the Earth's subsurface. This service is ideal for passive monitoring, urban geophysics, infrastructure analysis, and environmental applications.</p>

  <h3>3. Custom Machine Learning Models for Geophysical Data</h3>
  <p>From training deep neural networks to applying unsupervised learning for pattern recognition in geophysical time series, we develop bespoke AI solutions that accelerate interpretation and improve subsurface characterization.</p>

  <h3>Additional Services</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Training & Workshops:</strong> We offer short courses and training programs in geophysical signal processing, machine learning, and seismic interpretation.</li>
    <li><strong>Open-Source Software Development:</strong> We contribute and maintain open-source tools that support reproducible and scalable geoscience research.</li>
    <li><strong>Consulting & Joint Research Proposals:</strong> We collaborate with academic and industry partners on research, grant proposals, and custom geophysical solutions.</li>
  </ul>
