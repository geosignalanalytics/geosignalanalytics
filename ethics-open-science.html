    <h1>Ethics & Open Science</h1>
    <p>
      Upholding scientific integrity, transparency, and responsible research
      practices in geophysical and computational Earth sciences.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
  <main>

    <section>
      <h2>Scientific Integrity and Research Ethics</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>GeoSignal Research Institute (GSRI)</strong> is committed to the
        highest standards of scientific integrity, ethical conduct, and
        professional responsibility. All research activities conducted within
        the Institute adhere to internationally recognized principles of honesty,
        rigor, transparency, and accountability.
      </p>

      <p>
        GSRI promotes ethical research practices across data acquisition,
        processing, interpretation, and publication, ensuring that scientific
        outcomes are reproducible, verifiable, and free from conflicts of interest.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Responsible Use of Data</h2>
      <p>
        The Institute recognizes the critical importance of responsible data
        stewardship, particularly in geophysical research involving sensitive
        environmental, infrastructural, or societal contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        GSRI follows best practices in data governance, including appropriate
        data anonymization, secure storage, and compliance with legal,
        institutional, and contractual obligations associated with proprietary
        or confidential datasets.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Open Science and Reproducibility</h2>
      <p>
        GSRI actively supports the principles of <strong>Open Science</strong> by
        encouraging transparent methodologies, reproducible workflows, and,
        where possible, open dissemination of research outputs.
      </p>

      <p>
        This includes the publication of open-access articles, the sharing of
        codes, algorithms, and computational frameworks, and the documentation
        of data-processing pipelines to facilitate independent verification and
        reuse by the scientific community.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Ethical AI</h2>
      <p>
        As a research institute working at the intersection of geophysics and
        artificial intelligence, GSRI places particular emphasis on the ethical
        development and application of AI-based methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        We prioritize interpretable, physics-informed, and scientifically grounded
        machine learning approaches, avoiding black-box solutions when they
        compromise scientific understanding, robustness, or accountability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Publication Ethics and Authorship</h2>
      <p>
        GSRI adheres to internationally accepted standards regarding authorship,
        citation practices, peer review, and publication ethics. All contributors
        to scientific work are appropriately acknowledged, and plagiarism,
        data fabrication, and duplicate publication are strictly prohibited.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Institute encourages responsible peer-review participation and
        constructive scientific dialogue as essential components of academic
        integrity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Societal Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond academic excellence, GSRI acknowledges its responsibility toward
        society. Research activities are conducted with careful consideration of
        their environmental, social, and ethical implications.
      </p>

      <p>
        By promoting ethical science and open knowledge, the Institute seeks to
        contribute to informed decision-making, sustainable development, and
        the responsible use of subsurface resources worldwide.
