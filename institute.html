      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Signal Processing for Geoscientists and Engineers</strong> course bridges theory and practice by exploring modern approaches to data analysis, denoising, and reconstruction in geophysical applications.
        Participants gain hands-on experience with both <strong>traditional algorithms</strong> and <strong>deep learning architectures</strong> designed for seismic and Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Special emphasis is placed on <strong>simultaneous denoising and reconstruction of 2D–5D seismic datasets</strong> using state-of-the-art frameworks such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), Two-Step DIP (TSDIP), and transformer-based networks.
