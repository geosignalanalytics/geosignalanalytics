    <h1>About the Institute</h1>
    <p>
      An academic and scientific platform dedicated to rigorous research,
      computational innovation, and responsible geoscience.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Institutional Background</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>GeoSignal Research Institute (GSRI)</strong> is the academic and
        scientific branch of <strong>GeoSignal Analytics LLC</strong>. The Institute
        was established to provide a dedicated framework for fundamental and
        applied research in geophysics, signal processing, and data-driven
        subsurface analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        GSRI operates at the interface between academic research and advanced
        applied geoscience, with the objective of developing scientifically
        rigorous methodologies that address both theoretical challenges and
        real-world applications.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scientific Scope and Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        The Institute’s research philosophy is grounded in methodological rigor,
        physical interpretability, and long-term scientific vision. We emphasize
        computational geophysics, physics-informed data analysis, and artificial
        intelligence approaches that are transparent, reproducible, and firmly
        rooted in geophysical principles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work spans seismic imaging, signal processing, Distributed Acoustic
        Sensing (DAS), numerical modeling, and advanced machine learning methods
        for subsurface characterization.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Academic Mission and Knowledge Transfer</h2>
      <p>
        GSRI is committed to the production and dissemination of high-quality
        scientific knowledge through peer-reviewed publications, open research
        practices, and international collaboration. The Institute actively
        contributes to the training of students, early-career researchers, and
        professionals through advanced courses, workshops, and research-driven
        programs.
      </p>

      <p>
        By bridging academic research and applied geoscience, the Institute
        ensures responsible knowledge transfer while maintaining scientific
        independence and integrity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Positioning and International Outlook</h2>
      <p>
        The GeoSignal Research Institute operates within an international research
        ecosystem, collaborating with universities, research centers, and
        industry partners worldwide. Our activities are designed to meet
        international academic standards and contribute to global scientific
        discussions in Earth and data sciences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through its affiliation with GeoSignal Analytics LLC, the Institute
        maintains a unique position that enables close interaction between
        academic research and applied innovation, while preserving a clear
        distinction between scientific inquiry and commercial activities.
